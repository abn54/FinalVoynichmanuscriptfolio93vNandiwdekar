# Voynich Cipher Analyzer

## Project Overview
The **Voynich Cipher Analyzer** is a program designed to analyze and attempt to decode texts that may have been written using a cipher similar to the Voynich Manuscript's. The program applies various cipher techniques to analyze encrypted text and explores the possibility of decoding it. 

The analysis process includes the application of several cipher techniques:
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Transposition Cipher**

The analyzer performs frequency analysis and utilizes dictionaries of various ancient and modern languages to validate potential deciphered words. This provides insight into the nature of the text and whether it could be a meaningful language.

## Purpose Details
This program performs frequency analysis and attempts to decode a text possibly written in the Voynich manuscript style. It applies various cipher techniques (Caesar cipher, monoalphabetic substitution, Vigenère cipher, transposition cipher) to decipher encrypted text. The analysis is optimized for Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, Egyptian, Etruscan, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Portuguese, Proto-Romance, and Sumerian using dictionaries to validate words. Future extensions could include support for additional cipher techniques and more advanced frequency analyses.
